# Customer Churn-Scikit
Predicting customer churn using Scikit-learn library. This is a binary classification problem which has been solved usinf following algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM
3. Random Forest
4. XGBoost Classifier
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes

All the algorithms(expect GNB) have been fit using paramter grid to find the most accurate hyperparameter.
